#Description:
Collaborative whiteboard app for Android products, where members can draw or add ideas to a shared blank slate, via touch input or the supported input of the particular Android device. We would like to add features for different colors, textures, shading effects, touch based inputs, and sound prompts. Also support individual prompts created by an administrator, that a specific user has to complete. Ideally this would be a fun and useful tool for kids to interact with each other and learn to work in a team environment, and potentially help teachers of young children.

#Vision Statement:
To make a fun, easy to use mobile app that allows quick collaboration with others, whether the user wants to communicate or just doodle.

#Motivation:
This project was intended to allow all of us to learn more about the Android SDK and mobile development in general. The collaborative nature of the app will allow us to experiment with networking, and should present us with some interesting problems to solve. Further we will be exposed to new disciplines of development, such as graphic design and networking. 

#Risks: 
None of the members on our team have experience with the Android SDK, nor do we know much about graphic design and networking. We also have to deal with potential security issues of dealing with a collaborative project, and not letting users exploit potential security issues or access private information.
